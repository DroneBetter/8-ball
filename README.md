# 8-ball
A Scratch implementation of 8-ball pool, with arbitrarily many sub-frame collisions and a gravity mode played around a black hole. (Interface not yet finished.)

## Modes

Hold `g` on startup for orbital 8-ball, `b` for around a binary black hole system instead (chaotic), `p` for a [Pi calculator](https://youtu.be/jsYwFizhncE), `a` for an experimental mode with a planet and aerodynamic drag, and `c` for orbital chess.

## Play in web browser

Ideally, [use TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/470794770/fullscreen?hqpen&offscreen&fps=60) (which runs it much faster in Javascript). If that doesn't work, use the [Scratch web player](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/470794770/fullscreen/) (which is only 30fps and has fencing (making all of the table appear black instead of the area around it), which is disabled in the TurboWarp one).


## Python file
This repository also contains my first attempt at reimplementing the physics engine for this in Python, which was unsuccessful, see [my reimplementation of my 3D engine](https://github.com/DroneBetter/Perspective3Dengine/blob/main/perspective%203D%20engine.py) instead (an improved version which supersedes this).
