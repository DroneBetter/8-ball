Ideally, [use TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/470794770/fullscreen?hqpen&offscreen&fps=60) (which runs it much faster in Javascript). If that doesn't work, use the [Scratch web player](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/470794770/fullscreen/) (which is only 30fps and has fencing (making all of the table appear black instead of the area around it), which is disabled in the TurboWarp one).
